## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <your-github-repository-url>
cd sih-college-portal
```

### 2. Setup the Backend (server)
Navigate to the server directory and install the dependencies.
```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create a `.env` file in the server directory and add the following environment variables:

```env
# MongoDB Connection
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string

# JWT Secret Key
JWT_SECRET=your_super_secret_key

# Frontend URL
CLIENT_URL=http://localhost:3000

# Cloudinary Credentials (for file uploads)
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=your_cloud_name
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=your_api_key
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=your_api_secret

# Supabase (for storage & profile/team logos)
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
SUPABASE_BUCKET=your_bucket_name
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key

# SMTP Credentials (for password reset emails)
SMTP_HOST=your_smtp_host
SMTP_PORT=your_smtp_port
SMTP_USER=your_smtp_user
SMTP_PASS=your_smtp_pass
```

### 3. Setup the Frontend (client)
Navigate to the client directory and install the dependencies.
```bash
cd ../client
npm install
```

Create a `.env.local` file in the client directory and add the following:
```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:5001
```

### 4. Run the Application
You will need two separate terminals to run both the backend and frontend servers.

In Terminal 1 (from the project root):
```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

In Terminal 2 (from the project root):
```bash
cd client
npm run dev
```

Your application should now be running, with the frontend available at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and the backend at [http://localhost:5001](http://localhost:5001).

## üåê Deployment

To deploy this project in production:

### 1. Backend Deployment
* Use a platform like **Render**, **Railway**, or **AWS EC2** to deploy the backend server.
* Make sure to set all environment variables in the platform‚Äôs dashboard (same as `.env` file).
* Use a production MongoDB connection (MongoDB Atlas is recommended).

### 2. Frontend Deployment
* Deploy the frontend on **Vercel** or **Netlify**.
* Set environment variables (`NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL`, `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_BUCKET`) in the deployment dashboard.
* Point `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL` to your deployed backend URL.

### 3. Supabase Setup
* Create a Supabase project.
* Create a public storage bucket (for profile pictures & team logos).
* Copy the `SUPABASE_URL`, `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY`, and bucket name to your environment variables.

### 4. Domain Setup
* Optionally, connect a custom domain (e.g., `portal.yourcollege.com`) to the frontend deployment.
* Configure `CLIENT_URL` in backend `.env` to match the production domain.

Your project will now be fully deployed with working image storage, authentication, and team management features.
